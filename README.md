# Task Manager
## README

This is an example task manager application that i wanted to build in order to practice my front and backend skills.

The backend is built using some boilerplate from rmdashfv's repo (which I misteriously cannot find anymore).

The frontend is buld using Vite/React.

To run the server:

1. From /server run 
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  -`gunicorn app:app`
2. From /client run 
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run dev`
3. In the browser go to the local host port you just opened.
